## 🧠 Mental Health Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project presents a predictive machine learning framework to assess the likelihood of individuals requiring mental health treatment, using workplace survey data. The system leverages multiple supervised learning models, ensemble methods, and SHAP interpretability to build an explainable and scalable mental health analytics tool.
